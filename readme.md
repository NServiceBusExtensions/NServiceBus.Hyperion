## Community backed

**This is a community backed project. Backing is done via [opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions](https://opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions/).**

**It is expected that any developer that uses any of these libraries [become at a backer](https://opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions#contribute).** This is an honesty system, there is no code that enforces this requirement. However when raising an issue or a pull request, the GitHub users name may be checked against [the list of backers](https://github.com/NServiceBusExtensions/Home/blob/master/backers.md), and that issue/PR may be closed without further examination.
